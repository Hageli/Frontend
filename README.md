MADE BY MIRO HAGELBERG

This is the repository of Software Development Skills: Front-End coursework. The code for tasklist and the project are stored in separate folders within this repository.

Learning diary and video of the code runthrough can be found in Documents-folder. Websites for both the tasklist and the project are hosted from separate repositories, which both include the exact same source code that is found in this repository. The separate repositories can be found from the following URLs:

Tasklist:
https://github.com/Hageli/frontend_tasklist

Project:
https://github.com/Hageli/frontend_project


RUNNING THE CODE:

1. Choose which part of the code you want to run (Tasklist or Project) and click open the folder of your choice. 
2. Open that folder in terminal and run "npm install" to install all the required node_modules.
3. Install the extension Live Server in Visual Studio Code.
4. Find the index.html file in your folder (./Project/dist/index.html OR ./Tasklist/dist/index.html) -> right click the index.html file -> Open with Live Server
5. The website should be opened inside a browser on your machine

TESTING THE WEBSITE WITHOUT VISUAL STUDIO CODE:

Tasklist:
https://hageli.github.io/frontend_tasklist

Project:
https://hageli.github.io/frontend_project

You can follow the links above to directly access the website hosted by GitHub. This does not require running the code and has all the same functionality as running the code yourself.
